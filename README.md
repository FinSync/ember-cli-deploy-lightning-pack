# ember-cli-deploy-lightning-pack

This addon is a plugin pack for the upcoming ember-cli-deploy 0.5.0 release. It bundles the plugins you need to have a deployment pipeline for your Ember app similar to what I described in my talk: Lightning Fast Deployment of Your Rails-backed JavaScript https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZVYP3cPcWQ

It also has a blueprint for your `config/deploy.js` file to get you started.

## Usage

* Wait for ember-cli-deploy 0.5.0 to be released
* `ember install ember-cli-deploy`
* `ember install ember-cli-deploy-lightning-pack`
